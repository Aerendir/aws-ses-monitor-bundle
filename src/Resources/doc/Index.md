AWS SES Monitor Bundle Documentation
====================================

Using the bundle is really simple and in a matter of minutes you'll be able to manage bounces and complaints of e-mails sent through AWS SES.

**These are the steps required to make the bundle work**:

1. [Install and activate the bundle](Installation.md)
2. [Configure the bundle](Configuration.md)
3. [Configure AWS SES through the built-in commands](Integration.md)
4. [Test the sending of e-mails](Test.md)
5. [Using the information collected](Using.md)

After you have done this, your app will automatically manage bounces, complaints and deliveries and your AWS SES account will be safe and never deactivated by Amazon.
